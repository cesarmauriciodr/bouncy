# ZINA (test)
Technical test for Zina Team / Nokia

### Problem
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.

Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.

Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly 99%.

### Prerequisites
 * Python 3.6.5
 * virtualenv

### Installing
Clone or download project from: 
```
https://github.com/cesarmauriciodr/bouncy.git
```

Activate virtualenv

source bouncy-env/bin/activate
```

Install requirements (for run test), go to project and run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run project
go to project and just run:

```
python3 bouncy_main.py <percentage>
```
Enjoy!! =)
